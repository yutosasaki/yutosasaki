# Yuto Sasaki

Hi, I'm Yuto — a consultant and software engineer working at the intersection of **XR**, **real-time 3D**, and **interactive product prototyping**.

I specialize in delivering **proof-of-concept (PoC) to scalable implementation** with a strong focus on cross-disciplinary technologies like **Unreal Engine**, **Unity**, **AI**, and **cloud-native infrastructure**.

## 👋 About Me

I'm a Tokyo-based engineer with a background in VR/AR/MR development and organizational process improvement.  
Over the past few years, I’ve led multiple XR and metaverse projects, ranging from rapid PoC to pre-production for mass-market products.

My approach emphasizes:
- Building momentum-driven teams
- Bridging between engineering, UX, and product management
- Establishing reusable patterns for fast project onboarding and knowledge transfer
