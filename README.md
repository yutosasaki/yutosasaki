## 👋 About Me

I'm a Tokyo-based engineer with a background in VR/AR/MR development and organizational process improvement.  
Over the past few years, I’ve led multiple XR and metaverse projects, ranging from rapid PoC to pre-production for mass-market products.

My approach emphasizes:
- Building momentum-driven teams
- Bridging between engineering, UX, and product management
- Establishing reusable patterns for fast project onboarding and knowledge transfer
